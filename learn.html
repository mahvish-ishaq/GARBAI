            <h2>Tips for Effective Waste Disposal</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Segregate waste at the source into organic, recyclable, and hazardous.</li>
                <li>Use biodegradable bags for organic waste.</li>
                <li>Clean recyclable items before disposal to reduce contamination.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Understanding Waste Categories</h2>
            <p>Waste is typically divided into four categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic:</strong> Food scraps, garden waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Recyclable:</strong> Plastics, paper, metal, glass.</li>
                <li><strong>Hazardous:</strong> Batteries, chemicals, electronic waste.</li>
                <li><strong>Electronic:</strong> Old gadgets, cables, and appliances.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Importance of Waste Segregation</h2>
            <p>Waste segregation is a crucial step in effective waste management. By properly sorting waste at the source, we can significantly reduce environmental pollution, improve recycling efficiency, and conserve natural resources.Proper segregation ensures efficient recycling, reduces landfill use, and promotes environmental sustainability.</p>
            <p> Here‚Äôs why it matters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduces Landfill Waste:</strong>When waste is mixed, recyclables and organic materials often end up in landfills, taking up valuable space and causing long-term environmental damage.
                    Proper segregation ensures that only non-recyclable waste is sent to landfills, reducing waste accumulation.</li>
                <li><strong> Enhances Recycling Efficiency:</strong>Recycling plants require clean and sorted materials to efficiently process waste into new products.
                    When waste is segregated properly, plastics, paper, glass, and metals can be reused, reducing the demand for raw materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Landfills generate methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.
                    By segregating organic waste for composting, we can reduce methane emissions and promote sustainable waste disposal.</li>
                <li><strong>Saves Costs & Resources:</strong> Proper waste segregation helps governments and municipalities cut down on waste collection and disposal costs.
                    It also reduces the need for raw material extraction, conserving energy and natural resources.</li>
                <li> Prevents Pollution & Protects Ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <p>Effective waste segregation is everyone‚Äôs responsibility. Whether at home, in schools, or workplaces, sorting waste into recyclable, organic, and non-recyclable categories ensures a cleaner environment, a healthier planet, and a more sustainable future.
